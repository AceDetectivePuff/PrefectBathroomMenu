<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/1.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Caitatoes' Dragon Egg Quiche with Summer Vegetables! The dragon guards her hoard jealously. Also, had to make a Gryffindor Inspired drink!</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/2.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Thinly slice the dragon's garden. Half a zucchini and half a yellow squash, one bell pepper, 5-6 mushrooms, half an onion, one small potato, 5 cloves garlic.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/3.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Fry with a few tablespoons butter (the more butter the more flavor, of course.) Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, dill, rosemary. The dragon will practically thank you for taking its vegetables!</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/4.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">So the fried veg doesn't cook the eggs when they hit, let it cool off some and add about 1/4 cup milk to the pan for faster cooling. Mix with 8 dragon eggs.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/5.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">Pour into your tin - the dragon once again must watch over its gold (get it? it's yolks). Bake at 350F for 40 minutes.</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/6.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">The finished product, straight out the oven!</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/7.jpg%}" alt=""class="post-left"><p class="wide">The dragon seems pleased with the results. It can add this quiche to its hoard (and also eat it for breakfast, like I will.)</p></div>

<div class="post-container"><img src="{%link /images/DEQ/8.jpg%}" alt="" class="post-right"><p class="wide">Gratuitous quiche close-up. Look at those vegetables. Amazing!</p></div>
