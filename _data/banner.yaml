  Come seek us where our food is found,
  <br>We cannot eat above the ground,
  <br>And while you're searching savor this;
  <br>We're making what you'll sorely miss,
  <br>An hour long you'll have to look,
  <br>And to enjoy what we cook,
  <br>But past an hour, your prospect's black,
  <br>Too late, we're gone, we won't come back.
